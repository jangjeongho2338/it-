- application programmer =  write program that perform specific category of tasks
- system programmer = write program maintain and control computer network, database, system
- programmer step
- 1. get a high school education
- 2. Meet programmer education requirements
- 3. choose a specialization

- want programmer you know data structure and algorithms
- data structure and algorithms = important topics of any programming job without knowing basic data strutures it not possible to write

- source control = useful to store your code and cooperate with programmer within team
- git = help to cooperate without overriding each other changes
- command line git branch merge use

- Text editors(Vim) : DBA(database admin) or non-programmer essential tool
